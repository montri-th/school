/**
 * First Aha: where the recorded students concentrate — the top เขต/อำเภอ of the leading province — and how close
 * they sit to rail.
 *
 * Measure: students recorded per district by default (Σ student_count of CityMETER 2026, LI `li.supply`), or schools
 * (`count`) when the reader switches the measure. Students are the counts the source records for its schools, so the
 * figure is “how many students the source records”, never a school-age population, an enrolment rate, a capacity or
 * a density per person.
 *
 * One 3D frame: the leading province is the province holding the most of the measure among rows placed at district
 * level; the Aha shows up to three districts of that province with the most of it (one coherent city scene) and
 * their share of the province's whole total in the selection (`homeValue`: placed rows and rows the sources place
 * only at province level — the Hotel rule of 2026-11-01, natural copy: “12% ของนักเรียนกรุงเทพมหานคร”) — numerator and
 * denominator stated. The focus is never every district
 * that holds the measure (a province with N ≤ 3 such districts shows its top N − 1; “100% in all of them” says
 * nothing). The district with the most of the measure outside that province is the third finding.
 *
 * Ties: the focus never cuts through a tie. When the district after the last one shown has the same value, only
 * the districts strictly above that value are shown (possibly one, possibly none). With none — every district of
 * the province holds the same value — the Aha says the supply is spread (`spread`), not concentrated. The outside
 * finding lists every district tied at its top value.
 *
 * Rail (CityMETER · Transit, a dataset of the same registry): the share of the measure within RAIL_M metres in a
 * straight line of an operating rail station, among the focus rows that carry a point, against the rest of the same
 * province's placed rows with a point. Both bases are stated; rows without a point are left out of both and their
 * total is stated. A straight-line radius is not a walking route or a catchment.
 *
 * Snapshot values in the handoff JSON are regression fixtures, never UI constants.
